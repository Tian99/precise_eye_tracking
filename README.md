Eye pupil Tracker

This project aimed at tracking object's people in noisy environment(With pupil hardly distinguishsble from the background). Methods include hough transform and machine learning.

It's not finished yet due to the slowness of hough transform and imprecision of machine learning. Solutions include conda GPU runnign environment and later may add c++ to the picture to boost up the speed and precision.
