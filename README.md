Eye pupil Tracker

This project aimed at tracking object's pupil in noisy environment(With pupil hardly distinguishable from the background). Methods include hough transform and machine learning.

It's not finished yet due to the lag of hough transform and imprecision of machine learning. Solutions include conda GPU runnign environment and later may add c++ to the picture to boost up the speed and precision.
